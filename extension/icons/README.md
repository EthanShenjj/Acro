# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing tool. The icons should:

- Have a transparent background
- Use the Acro brand colors
- Be simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Include a camera or recording symbol

## Temporary Placeholder

For development, you can use simple colored squares or generate icons using online tools like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/

Replace these placeholders with proper branded icons before publishing.
